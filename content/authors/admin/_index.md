   # summary: |
    #  Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello!  
I'm Ronak, a robotics graduate student at University of Minnesota. I'm constantly looking for problems to solve or processes to make more efficient. I love hacking on hardware. Tools helped humans build civilizations, and I believe robots are the next iteration. They'll help us build at scale and eventually climb the Kardashev scale. I want to be part of that story. We're not there yet, so let's roll up our sleeves and get to work.

I'm a bit of a tech geek and most of my free time is spent building things. On holidays I love exploring the outdoors with family and friends. I'm curious about how things work. If you want to talk about something interesting, feel free to reach out!

summary: I developed a quadcopter drone equipped with advanced autonomy and mapping capabilities. The project integrates SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using Hector SLAM for 2D mapping and ORB-SLAM3 for 3D visual-inertial navigation. To enable autonomous flight, I implemented behavioral cloning, allowing the drone to learn and replicate human-controlled maneuvers.

I developed a novel Human-Machine Interface (HMI) to simplify programming industrial robotic manipulators. The system uses a wireless pointer <!--more--> and a stereo camera for intuitive point selection and task simulation. By integrating ROS, ArUco markers, and a visual feedback device, operators can program robots without coding expertise. Tested on multiple manipulators, the project achieved high accuracy with an RMSE under 6.5 mm. This work demonstrates how accessible automation can enhance efficiency in industrial, educational, and creative fields.
